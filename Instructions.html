<h1>how to play the game </h1>
<p> Try the same color balls in vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lines. To move the ball, click it, select, and click the Single. If there are more than five balls in the same color on the line, the line will be deleted from the board and you can get score points. The line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Touch the ball then target position. But remember, for each turn, the computer adds three new balls. </P>
